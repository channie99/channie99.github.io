<h1 >Escape Room</h1>
<p> On the other side of the room are file maps, they look like patient records with names on them, you just have to find the right one</p>

<ul class="iiioptions">
	<li><a href="open.html">the right file is the file of Mister Smith.</a></li>
	<li class="active"><a href="question9.html">The right file is the file of Mister Simon</a></li>
	<li><a href="question5.html">You don't know the right file, so you leave the files alone and walk around the room.</a></li>
</ul>
