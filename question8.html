<h1 >Escape Room</h1>
<p>There is only one codelock in the room, and that's the door, but there are 6 numbers necessary to open it, so you can't use that code. There are two things you can do:</p>

<ul class="iioptions">
	<li><a href="question1.html">Start over from question 1</a></li>
	<li class="active"><a href="close.html">Wait till the door opens after an hour</a></li>

</ul>
