<ul class="iioptions">
	<li><a href="question12.html">There is only one (sort of) person in the room, besides you and your friend, and that's the skeleton, maybe that's Mister Smith</a></li>
	<li class="active"><a href="question14.html">A name is on a file, so you go to the files that are in the room</a></li>
