<h1>Escape Room</h1>
<p>Maybe you know the concept of an escape room. A group of people (mostly friends) get locked up in a small room where they have to escape from within an hour. Trough games they get hints and answers to find the last key or code to open the door. This is slightly different, you are alone, online and won't get any hints. The only thing you have to do is to get the right answers. Every answer will get you to a next page, but be aware, the answer doesn't have to be right to go further. It's a maze of possibilities and mistakes. </p>

<p>Are you ready for this challenge?</p>
